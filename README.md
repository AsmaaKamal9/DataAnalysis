# DataAnalysis and Data Wrangling Project for Udacity Nano-Degree
As a part of the project “Data wrangle and Analyse” in the Udacity Data Analyst -Professional Nanodegree; this project is about data wrangling for the Twitter account “WeRateDogs”.
‘WeRateDogs’ is a twitter account that rates people’s dogs with humours comments. The rating denominator is almost equal to 10, but ironically the rating numerator most of the 
time can be 12, 13, 14, Why? Because, people love dogs more than the imaginable, so why not! 


# Softwares used
- You need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook.

- The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. You can install these packages via conda or pip.

pandas, NumPy, requests, tweepy, json

# Project Specifications:
## Data Wrangling process invovled three main steps:
- Data Gathering
- Data Assessing
- Data Cleaning

# Data Gathering:
Data is successfully gathered From at least 3 different sources.

Each piece of data is imported into a separate pandas DataFrame at first.

# Data Assessing
Two types of assessment are used:
- Visual assessment: each piece of gathered data is displayed in the Jupyter Notebook for visual assessment purposes. 
- Programmatic assessment: pandas' functions and/or methods are used to assess the data.
At least eight (8) data quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues are detected, and include the issues to clean to satisfy the Project Motivation. Each issue is documented in one to a few sentences each.

# Data Cleaning

- The define, code, and test steps of the cleaning process are clearly documented.
- Copies of the original pieces of data are made prior to cleaning.
- All issues identified in the assess phase are successfully cleaned using Python and pandas.
- A tidy master dataset with all pieces of gathered data is created.

The wrangle_report file illustrates how the wrangling process was done in details.

# Data Visualizing 

The visualization process is illustrated in wrangle_act file.
At least 3 insights were presented and one visualization labeled.
